 Design the Metamaterial Violin: body crafted from acoustic cloaking materials that redirect sound waves...

# Summary

# Conceptual Summary

The organogram for the Metamaterial Violin abstracts its core innovation: a resonant body shaped from acoustic metamaterials that redirect and sculpt sound waves. The primary acoustical shape is a vertical rectangle (chordophone) in deep violet, representing the traditional violin body, but it is embedded with a tessellated hexagonal lattice in cyan, symbolizing the metamaterial's wave-steering properties. A smaller orange circle denotes the genus (bowed string). The interface is shown as a light grey vertical rectangle (the fingerboard) with a white arrow indicating the bowing motion along the strings. Four blue numbers (4) mark the strings. A performer's position is indicated by a white circle with a dotted line connecting to the instrument. Arrows flow from the bowing interface into the metamaterial lattice, illustrating how vibrational energy is captured and redirected. The acoustical rationale is visualized through a superimposed spectrum simulation (green waveform) showing enhanced low-mid resonance and suppressed high-frequency harshness, due to the cloaking effect. This design positions the instrument within organology as a hybrid chordophone-electronophone, merging traditional string excitation with advanced material science for performative control over sound diffusion and projection.
